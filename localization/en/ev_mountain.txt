Yo, Merch! Over here!

*n_01
Uh...are you talking to me?

*mb2_02
<m fadein>Huh? Oh, whoops!
*
We thought you were that elf merchant that stops by occasionally.

*mb1_03
She’s the only elf that ever comes here. I just saw the ears and thought you were her, <m scary>gahaha!

// 2回目

*mb1_10
Think her name was Nightingale or something. She carries a whole pack of stuff up here from the forest.

*mb2_11
Dunno how she does it, being as skinny as she is.

*mb1_12
She’s probably stronger than you. You should try arm-wrestling her next time she’s around.

*mb2_13
Haha, I’m pretty sure I would win, but I don’t think it’s worth the potential embarrassment.

*___mountain/_caravan_church_t00 mb_0
This is the Mount Fallen branch of the Heavenly Facilities. We also look after orphaned children here.

*mb_10
Us beastment were born from our Father, who we were separated from when he ascended to Heaven.
*
In that sense, we are kindred spirits with the children we look after.


// ちゃらそうなお姉さん

*___mountain/_caravan_church_t01 mb_00
Why do orphans even exist?

*mb_01
The Heavenly Facilities only prepare as many bodies as are needed, so there shouldn’t be any extras.

*mb_02
So then, are orphans made by accident or something?

*n_03
Well, that’s not an entirely incorrect way to phrase it, but...
*
You see...elves and beastmen differ in how they’re created.

*mb_04
<angry><m ple>They do!? Then, how is an elf made!?

*n_05
<m scary>W-Well...when a man and a woman get together...they...uh...
*
<m ple>I’m sorry, I have to go!


//夜に話を聞く
*mb_10
Before I got assigned here, I failed at everything I did.
*
Watching over these children, playing with them...
I think I've found my calling.
*
I hope one day each of them will find their passion too.


// 獣人のシスター。小さなお墓の前で

*___mountain/_caravan_church_t10 mb1_0
This is the graveyard for elf children who passed away here.
*
We do not understand why our Father calls them back to him so soon, but perhaps that is not for us to know.
*
Their souls watch down on us all the same.
*
Us beastmen do not know such joy. Our souls are called back to the Mother Tree.
*
And when the time comes, we are given a new body and reborn at the Heavenly Facilities.

*mb1_10
Does each individual beastman even have a proper soul?
*
With a new body, memories, and function given to them each time, how can you tell where one soul ends and another begins?
*
Some have claimed that beastmen don’t have souls at all.
*
That we’re just empty husks doing what we’re programmed to do.
*
The love that I feel for each child I care for tells me otherwise.

There’s a great fishing spot just out past the orphanage.
*
Our chickens get first dibs on whatever we catch.
*
Children get the next bite, then the rest of us.
*
We don’t mind starving a little bit if it’s for the sake of our chicken and children. We’re easy to replace!

*mb1_10
Jeff told me he saw a black ghost or something come outta the water down in the caves th’ other day.
*
Prob’ly just a hallucination from the higher concentration of mana down there.
*
He’d best check his filters to make sure they’re workin’ properly, or a hallucination’ll be the least of his worries.


*n_11
<think>A black ghost? That sounds unrelated to the mystery girl. Still, it’s kinda creepy...

// ファーストに出会っている

<think>A black ghost...down in the caves...near water...
That sounds like the fishing monster I ran into.

I’m looking for someone. She looks like an elf, but she has round ears, pink hair...

*mb1_03
Sorry, I don’t know anyone like that.

*mb1_04
Try asking in the tavern. Lots of people pass through there.
*
I’ll keep an eye out for her, though. Does she have any other distinguishing features?

*n_05
Um...her outfit is very revealing.

*mb1_06

Had a Grazian soldier come in here the other day lookin’ for trouble.

*mb_01
He blamed the whole Bermit attack on us. Called us <m scary>“a bunch of lazy, good-for-nothing, slackers!”

*mb_02
I told him the beastmen in Grazia are responsible for the barrier, go yell at them.

*mb_03
But he didn’t care. If one beastman is a screw-up, we all are, I guess...

Hey girl. Never seen you before. What brings you around?

*n_00
I’m looking for someone.

*mb_01
A friend, I’d wager.

*mb_01_2
Why don’t you pour me a drink?

*n_02
Oh, um...okay.

*mb_03
Hehe, thanks. Drinking’s about the only fun thing to do when you get to my age.

*mb_04
So, who'r y’lookin’ for? An elf? A beastman?

*n_05
I’m actually not sure what she is.
*
She’s got pink hair, round ears, red eyes, and a monster that follows her around.

*mb_06
Hmm, doesn’t sound like anyone I know.
*
Sorry, girl.

*mb_06_2
Although...hmm...
It’s a long shot, but you might check Tunnel One.

*n_06
Where’s that?

*mb_07
Underneath the settlement, just to the west.

*mb_08
We sealed it off after the mana plants became too much for us to handle.

*mb_08_2
<c5>Check the mine shaft where the coal elevators are<c0>. The entrance is about halfway up.
*
The rubble we blasted to close it off years ago shouldn’t be as sturdy as it once was.

*n_10
<c5>Halfway up the elevator shaft<c0>...
Got it, thanks!

*mb_09
Think our security system used to run through that tunnel.
*
Ah, smart girl like you...you’ll figure a way around it...(hic).

*mb_11
If you find your friend, tell her to stop playin’ around with monsters. Ain’t good gettin’ ‘em all riled up like they been...

No.

<m scary>A ghost came out of the underground river!!
<m0>It was black and shaped like a person!
*
It was all like “Woo, woo!”, and then it ran towards me and disappeared.

*mb2_03
You’re drunk.

*mb1_10
I’m telling you, I know what I saw!
*
We gotta report this to the boss!

*mb2_11
Go for it. He’ll put you on mining duty until you die of exhaustion for wasting his time.

Do you know about the subterranean civilization?
*
Well, it’s just a theory for now, but the artifacts we’ve dug up suggest that a whole race lived underground around here.
*
We’re working on building a timeline based on the strata where each artifact was found.


*mb_10
Some of us believe the underground civilization still exists today!
*
The Grazian Orthodoxy even mentions “goblins” that were driven underground.
*
How connected the religious texts are with actual history is still unknown, though.
*
I’m making it my life’s work to discover the truth!

Elevator’s dead. Must’ve been an outage at the power plant.

I’d go check on it, but a bunch of mana plants have sprouted up near the entrance.
*
Sigh, when it rains, it pours.

*mb_10
We’re already short-handed with all the workers they took to clean up the Grazia attack.
*
Now they want to take even more of us for monster extermination operations. It just never ends.

<MT l=-1>Wait, don’t change the subject!


// 合流
*n_06
You sounded like you were in trouble. Is everything okay?

*s_07
Far from it.
*
The monsters used these tunnels to get to Grazia for their most recent attack.
*
They wrecked everything on their way through. Even our coal elevator is busted.

*s_09
I fired up this old cannon to help clear the rubble, but I didn’t bring enough fuel.
*
It caused just enough of a rumble to cave-in my only exit.

*s_10
I tried a more relaxed approach to my work like Walross does, but it just doesn’t work for me. I’m a “measure twice” kind of guy.

*n_11
Well, at least you didn’t get hurt.

*s_12
Hey, I’ve got an idea. Why don’t you try firing the cannon?

*n_13
<m ple>M-Me!?
<m0>But, you said there wasn’t enough fuel! And I didn’t bring any with me!

*s_14
Sure you did. Mana is the fuel.

*s_15
Just <c5>channel some into your staff and give it a good whack from the back</c5>.

*n_16
You mean my <c5>shotgun ability<c0>?

*s_17
Yeah, that.

<c5>It’ll take a fully charged one<c0> to get it movin’.


// 2度目

*n_30
I’ve never fired a cannon before...
Are you sure it’ll be alright?

*s_31
Should be. Just remember to <c5>fully charge your shotgun<c0> before striking it.

*s_32
Don’t worry about scattering excess mana everywhere. I’ve got plenty of filters on me.

I knew you could do it.

*n_01
It wasn’t anything special, but I’m glad it worked out.

*n_02
Looks like the elevator is still down, though...

*s_03
Yeah, we’re pretty sure the monsters damaged the power plant during their rampage.

*s_04
It’s just up ahead through that opening.

*s_05
We need to restart the power, but there’s some mana plants growing just outside the facility.
*
I’m not sure what to do...
Should I assemble an extermination team?

*n_06
If it’s just a few monsters, I can take care of them.

*s_07
Really!?
<m joy>Oh, thank you!

*s_08
Sigh, every time I think I’ve reached the end of my tale, you show up and save me.

*n_08
<think>The end of your tail?

*s_09
It’s not a proper thank you, but if you find anything useful in the power plant, feel free to take it.
*
There’s probably some stuff in there that’s <c5>only useful to an elf<c0>.


//再度話しかけ
*s_20
The power plant is just up ahead.

There’s some strong winds and mana plants growing nearby.
