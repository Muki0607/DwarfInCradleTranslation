# DwarfInCradleTranslation(DICT)
DICT(Dwarf In Cradle Translation) is a language patch for AliceInCradle that is customized by the player community, which is an action game developed by [NanameHacha](https://nanamehacha.dev/about). After installation, this mod will add English/Simplified Chinese/Traditional Chinese/Japanese translation for all Dwarf symbols in the game, depending on the game's language.


Specifically, a heroine "Alice" in Chapter 2 "The Ghost" uses a special language "Dwarf language". In game text files, dwarf language is mostly represented using hiragana and some kanji. In the game, they are displayed as regular ideographic symbols. You can check them in ```alphabet.png``` under this project.(Except punctuation marks).

Therefore, this project tries to add the translation before Alice's each sentence, so players can know their meaning at the same time. For example:

```AliceInCradle localization
<m scary>The elf has come!      // translation result
<dwarf><m scary>え来了!         // original text
```

## Download

2. Copy the ```localization``` folder from this project and paste it into the ```AliceInCradle_Data/StreamingAssets/ ```folder. When prompted with "Replace or Skip Files," choose "Replace the files in the destination." (If you do not see such a prompt, you most likely pasted the folder into the wrong directory.)
